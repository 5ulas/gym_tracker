1. [x] Implement "Next Session" Recommendations: The app looks at last session's performance and auto-populates target weight/reps with smart progression rules (increase weight if top of rep range + easy/medium, maintain if hard, +1 rep if working toward max).

2. [x] Volume/Frequency Heatmap: Visual muscle group heatmap showing training frequency over the last 4 weeks, accessible from the History tab.

3. [x] "Previous Best" Reference: Personal record (PR) bar displayed above input fields showing all-time best weight x reps and best session volume.

4. [x] Custom Workout Builder: Exercise database expanded from 15 to 73 exercises across all muscle groups (Chest, Back, Shoulders, Arms, Legs, Core). Existing search and filter functionality works with the expanded list. Existing users automatically get new exercises merged in.

5. [x] Exercise Swapper: During an active workout, users can tap the swap button on any exercise to see biomechanically similar alternatives (e.g., Bench Press -> Dumbbell Press, Incline Press). Swapping preserves any already-logged sets.

6. [x] Export/Import Data: Settings tab with full data backup and restore. Export downloads a JSON file with all exercises, routines, and workouts. Import validates the file structure and replaces current data with confirmation. Also includes storage stats overview and a danger-zone clear-all-data option.
